We see from [intel](http://ctf.cyberhacktics.com/intel) page spookyboi is recruiter 
![](assets/web-exploitation/what-lies-in-the-shadows_2.png)
So search for his posts in the [ghosttown](https://www.ghosttown.xyz) we see [this discussion](https://www.ghosttown.xyz/t/trick-or-treat-smell-my-feet/52)
Then at below post he refer to a [pastebin link](https://pastebin.com/vbQZ7xwL) which contain `323epprcunnvtibo6no7libdxopwcaqgorho6slmpos7fimetb4zskad`

We can't decode this. Then we think that it is a onion link
Go to [link](323epprcunnvtibo6no7libdxopwcaqgorho6slmpos7fimetb4zskad.onion) in Tor Browser

So it is correct place.
Search for flag in page source [in the deadface.js](view-source:http://323epprcunnvtibo6no7libdxopwcaqgorho6slmpos7fimetb4zskad.onion/js/deadface.js) we see the flag.
